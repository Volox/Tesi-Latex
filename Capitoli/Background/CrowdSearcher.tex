CrowdSearch is targeted to enabling, promoting and understanding individual
and social participation to search \cite{fraternali2012crowdsearch}.
CrowdSearch uses the crowds as sources for the content processing and information
seeking processes; it fills the gap between generalized search systems, which
operate upon world-wide information - including facts and recommendations as
crawled and indexed by computerized systems { and social systems, capable of
interacting with real people, in real time \cite{fraternali2012crowdsearch}.
Crowd-searching can be defined as the promotion of individual and social participation
to search-based applications and improve the performance of information
retrieval algorithms with the calibrated contribution of humans \cite{paperboz}.
