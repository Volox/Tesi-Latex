Distributing computation (task computation) in the crowd means splitting
the task execution into atomic subtask that can be executed by a host (human or
not).

%is a client server paragidm where the server is in charge of splitting the worlload
%and distribute the atomic operations created to the clients.

Generally speaking \emph{computation distribution} is composed by few steps that
can be spotted in all its specialization (i.e. grid computing, cloud computing,
\hyperref[sec:bg:crowd:auto:parasitic]{parasitic computing}, etc.), here is the list:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item the server has to \textbf{split} the workload into smaller parallelizable
    operations
    \item the server \textbf{send the code}, among with the needed data, to the clients
    \item the client \textbf{run} the code
    \item the client \textbf{send the results} to the server
    \item the server \textbf{gather} the results from all the clients
    \item the server \textbf{join} the results
\end{enumerate}
The previous operations are the cornerstone of every distributed computing system,
altough they can be done in different ways of can be merged. For instance the
client can request the code to the server, the join process of the results can
be performed by the clients with subsequent distributed computing task, and so on.\\

Under the general name of \emph{distributed computing} we can refer to a wide
range of distributed application and/or architecture supporting it.
\nameref{sec:bg:crowd:human} are good examples of a specialization of the core
concept of \emph{distributed computing}, here we have that the computation is
performed by human being used as nodes for high level computation. Other
specialization are \emph{Grid computing}, where the nodes form a super virtual
computer, or \emph{Jungle computing}\footnote{Winner of the coolest name 2012},
where using diverse, distributed and highly non-uniform high performance computer
systems to achieve peak performance.\\


% nostra divisione in human e automatic
Following the subdivision presented in \autoref{tab:matrix} we separate the
concept of crowd-based computation distribution in two parts, \emph{Human
computation \& \ac{GWAP}} and \emph{Automatic computation}.
