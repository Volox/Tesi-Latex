%Crowd-based computation distribution


Under the name of \emph{Crowd-based computation distribution} can fall a lot of
different computational model. As shown in
\autoref{fig:crowd-distributed-computing}, distributing computation to the crowd
embodies not only the \ac{HC} field but also the concept of \emph{distributed
computing}, because the crowd can be composed by humans or computers. When dealing
with an \emph{automated crowd} we are speaking of \textbf{distributed computing},
otherwise we are dealing with a \emph{human crowd}.

Generally speaking \emph{computation distribution} is a paradigm for splitting
a task into atomic subtasks that can be performed on multiple nodes, eventually
the nodes send the result of the \emph{computation} back to the central hub.
Using a client-server architecture the list of operation required to have
\emph{computation distribution} is:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item the server \textbf{splits} the workload into atomic operations
    \item the server \textbf{send the task}, among with the needed data, to the
    clients
    \item the client \textbf{performs} the atomic task
    \item the client \textbf{send the results} back to the server
    \item the server \textbf{gather} the results from all the clients
    \item the server \textbf{join} the results
\end{enumerate}
The previous operations are the cornerstone of every \emph{computation
distribution} system, although they can be "implemented" in different ways or can
be joined together, they are always present.\\

Consistently with the \autoref{tab:matrix} and with the previous subdivision we
splitted the general problem of crowd-based computation distribution into two
fields: \emph{\acl{HC} \& \acl{GWAP}} and \emph{distributed computing}

In \ref{sec:bg:crowd:human} are presented the theoretical basis as long as
the state of the art tools that deals with \ac{HC} and the distribution of task
to a human crowd.

In \ref{sec:bg:crowd:auto} the concept of \emph{distributed computing} will
be presented and the main tools that implements this paradigm are described.
