%Crowd-based computation distribution
Distributing computation (task computation) in the crowd means splitting
the task execution into atomic subtask that can be executed by a host
(human or not).

Write something about the crowd based distribution of the tasks, use references
to (Mechanical turk \cite{little2010turkit}) if possible.

The online tool \citetitle{turk} provide a framework for the creation
distribution, execution and result gathering of task (called \ac{HIT}).
Diring the creation a \emph{Requester} 
The \emph{Requester} can push request for executing \ac{HIT}, these are
