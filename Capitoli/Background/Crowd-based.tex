%Crowd-based computation distribution


Under the name of \emph{Crowd-based computation distribution} can fall a lot of
different computational models. As shown in
\autoref{fig:crowd-distributed-computing}, distributing computation to the crowd
embodies not only the \ac{HC} field but also the concept of \emph{distributed
computing}, because the crowd can be composed by humans or computers. When dealing
with an \emph{automated crowd} we are speaking of \textbf{distributed computing},
otherwise we are dealing with a \emph{human crowd}.

Generally speaking \emph{computation distribution} is a paradigm for splitting
a task into atomic subtasks that can be performed on multiple nodes. Eventually
the nodes send the result of the \emph{computation} back to the central hub.
Using client-server as an example architecture, we can list the required
operation needed to obtain \emph{computation distribution}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item the server \textbf{splits} the workload into atomic operations
    \item the server \textbf{sends the task}, among with the needed data, to the
    clients
    \item the client \textbf{performs} the atomic task
    \item the client \textbf{sends the results} back to the server
    \item the server \textbf{gathers} the results from all the clients
    \item the server \textbf{joins} the results
\end{enumerate}
The previous operations are the cornerstone of every \emph{computation
distribution} system. Although they can be "implemented" in different ways or can
be joined together, they are present in all the distributed systems.\\

Consistently with the \autoref{tab:matrix} and with the previous subdivision we
splitted the general problem of crowd-based computation distribution into two
fields: \emph{\acl{HC} \& \acl{GWAP}} and \emph{distributed computing}

In \ref{sec:bg:crowd:human} are presented the theoretical basis as long as
the state-of-the-art tools that deals with \ac{HC} and the distribution of task
to a human crowd.

In \ref{sec:bg:crowd:auto} the concept of \emph{distributed computing} is
presented and the main tools that implement this paradigm are described.

In \ref{sec:bg:crowd:cs} is presented the concept of \emph{Crowdsearching},
a new paradigm for searching in the Web using the crowd as source of information.
