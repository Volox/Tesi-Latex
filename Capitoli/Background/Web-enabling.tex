Web-based computation implies that a client is able to perform almost any kind of task that usually
is done by an application software, as an example think about image analisys, audio/video playback
or socket connection; these operations are available to developers without the need of additional
libraries or external \emph{plugins}.

When building \ac{RIA} developers have to face the problem of building \emph{rich} web application
without the required tools for \textbf{communication}, \textbf{data access} and \textbf{data storage}.
Access to raw data of images or audio, API for file management, data storage and full-duplex
communication are all problems that could not be solved without using plugins like Flash or Silverlight.

The advent of HTML5 has brought a breath of fresh air to the Web. HTML5 specifies all these features
as part of the language specifications so they are being implemented in all mayor javascript
engines (Presto, V8, SquirrelFish, JÃ¤gerMonkey). This means that almost all the required tools to build
real \emph{rich} internet application are built-in in the \js{} language.

\begin{description}
  \item[Communication] is being empowered by the introduction of \emph{WebSocket} that enable full-duplex
  data exchange with the server. Also the introduction of \ac{CORS} give the developers the possibility
  to contact foreign servers using \ac{AJAX} without the need of a proxy for forwarding the requests.
  \item[Data access] is obtained using HTML5 media elements (\code{<video>} and \code{<audio>})
  or the File API.
  \item[Data storage] is available through the \code{localStorage} and \code{sessionStorage}
  global variables or using IndexedDB or even a built-in WebSQL database.
\end{description}


With the introduction of all these features developers can use the power of \js{} to perform image analysis,
audio/video palyback (without any external plugin installed), create 2D/3D games and so on.

% TODO Trova come e dove infilarlo im modo che sia collegato
These features make possible to create tools like \citetitle{emscripten} that is a LLVM-to-JavaScript compiler.
Basically allow developers to convert their C/C++ code into standard \js{}, obviously the performance
are not comparable but different level of code optimization lead to good performance gains in terms of
code size and execution speed.



% TODO Trovare come e dove metterlo
Additionally specification like \ac{CORS}, not strictly related to \js{}, allow the users to make
cross-site request, that was a great limitation in \js{} develpment.
