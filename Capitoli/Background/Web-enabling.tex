% Enabling web-based distributed computation

Using the web (i.e. the browser) as a platform for distributing and executing
code implies that we have the available technologies to perform high-level
\emph{computation} and real-time \emph{communication}. These are the requirements
for evaluating the web as a suitable platform for code distribution.\\

\paragraph{Computation} is the key for being able to perform tasks within the
browser. \emph{Computation} can involve any kind of operation on the data, and
the data itself can be of any type. For instance creating an application that
analyzes audio files, or creating a image manipulation program that runs without
external plugins is relatively simple using standard languages (e.g. C, C++,
Java, etc). Until a few years ago it was almost\footnote{Without using strange
interaction between Flash/Silverlight and the browser.} impossible to do it within
a browser.

HTML5 filled the gap that existed between any "standard" language and \js{}
giving the developers access to all the required APIs needed to create fully
functional web-applications. In \ref{sec:bg:web:html5} are presented all the
features, along with some technical details, that have enabled this evolution.\\

There are also initiatives that aim at simplify the deployment of \js{}
application. Since most of the developers have experience on languages other than
\js{} there is the need of porting existing application to the Web.
Projects like \citetitle{emscripten} and \citetitle{gwt}
offer the possibility to write the code directly in C,C++ (\citetitle{emscripten})
or Java (\citetitle{gwt}) and compile it into pure, and optimized, \js{}.

\citetitle{emscripten}, by Mozilla, is a LLVM-to-JavaScript compiler. It takes
LLVM bitcode (which can be generated from C/C++ using Clang, or any other
language that can be converted into LLVM bitcode) and compiles that into \js{}.
Since it is a compiler it offers multiple grades of optimization that reduce the
size of the \js{} file and speedup the computation. The website is full of demos
of the ported application, including games, 2D/3D game engines, various libraries
and also SQLite.

\citetitle{gwt}, by Google, is a development toolkit for building and optimizing
complex browser-based applications. Its goal is to enable productive development
of high-performance web applications without the developer having to be an expert
in browser quirks, XMLHttpRequest, and \js{}.\\



\paragraph{Communication} is being empowered by
introducing \emph{WebSocket}, that enables full-duplex data exchange with the
server, and \ac{CORS} that gives the developers the possibility to make \ac{AJAX}
requests to "foreign" servers (other than \code{localhost}) without the need of
a proxy for forwarding the requests.\\


% TODO non mi convince
The availability of all those technical API gives the possibility to create a
system capable of performing any \emph{Human} or \emph{Automatic} computation
task without the need of external plugins. We used all the features of HTML5
for the computation side of the System. WebSocket are used for real-time task
monitoring and \ac{CORS} are used within the task to request any
external data needed by the application.
