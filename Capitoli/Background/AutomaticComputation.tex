Unlike human computation, \emph{automatic computation} aims at executing a task, or
part of it, in an automatic fashion, without user's interaction. This kind of
\emph{distributed computation} leverages on the existence of a \emph{grid} of
connected nodes able to perform data intensive calculation.


Distributed computing deals with the execution of code on multiple computers
connected to a network. As stated in \cite{andrewsfoundations}: "\emph{Distributed
computing is a field of computer science that studies distributed systems. A
distributed system consists of multiple autonomous computers that communicate
through a computer network. The computers interact with each other in order to
achieve a common goal. A computer program that runs in a distributed system is
called a distributed program, and distributed programming is the process of
writing such programs.}"

The platforms that implements these solution use different frameworks for splitting
algorithms into atomic operations. One of these frameworks
is MapReduce\footcite{dean2008mapreduce} that, using the core concept of
\emph{Divide et impera}, can produce highly parallelizable algorithms.\\

The name "\emph{distributed computing}" refers to a wide range of different
applications (i.e. grid computing, cloud computing,
\nameref{sec:bg:crowd:auto:parasitic}, jungle computing\footnote{Winner of the
coolest name 2012}), that implement the same paradigm with different purposes.
Using the dimensions presented in \autoref{tab:matrix} we can divide the
core concept of \emph{distributed computing} into two subcategories: \emph{voluntary
computing} and \emph{parasitic computing}.


\subsubsection{Voluntary computing}
\label{sec:bg:crowd:auto:voluntary}
\emph{Voluntary computing} refers to all those \emph{distributed computation}
systems where the computation is performed on behalf of the users will. In such
systems users go to the website of the "project" they intend to support and, usually
by installing an ad-hoc client, give the resources (i.e. CPU idle time, storage,
etc.) of their machines to the chosen "project".\\

The first project implementing such computing paradigm was
\ac{GIMPS}\footnote{\url{http://www.mersenne.org/}}, started in 1995. Then other
platforms (such as \href{http://www.distributed.net/}{distributed.net},
\href{http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/}{SETI@home}, etc. ) have been developed to
support this type of computation.

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{boinc}
    \caption{The \acs{BOINC} computational flow.}
    \label{fig:boinc}
\end{figure}
\acf{BOINC}\footnote{\url{http://boinc.berkeley.edu/}} is an open-source software
for Voluntary computing and grid computing. \ac{BOINC} was originally developed
to support the \acf{SETI@home} project, before it became used as a platform for
other distributed computing applications. It consists of two parts: the back-end
server, running on Linux platforms, and the client, cross-platform, for the
end-user computing.\\

The client software allows users to connect to the \ac{BOINC} grid, to perform
computation. The flow of the execution, as depicted in \autoref{fig:boinc} is
the standard \emph{distributed computing}. Here is the list of actions performed
to run the task on the client:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item get instruction from the server on how to get all the resources needed
    to perform the task
    \item download all the resources from the server
    \item execute the downloaded application
    \item send the results obtained to the server
\end{enumerate}

There are over 40, at the time of writing, projects that leverage on
the \ac{BOINC} platform to perform computation on different application areas.
For example the aforementioned \ac{SETI@home} project uses this framework to
search for extraterrestrial intelligence by analyzing the narrow-band radio
signal coming from the Arecibo radio telescope.
