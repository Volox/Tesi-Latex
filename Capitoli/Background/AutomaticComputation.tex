Unlike human computation, \emph{automatic computation} aim at executing task, or
part of it, in an automatic fashoin, without user interaction. This kind of
\emph{distributed computation} leverage on the existence of a \emph{grid} of
connected nodes able to perform data intensive calculation.

The platforms that implement these solution use different frameworks for splitting
algorithms into atomic operation executable by the nodes. One of these frameworks
is MapReduce\footcite{dean2008mapreduce} that, using the core concept of
\emph{Divide et impera} can produce highly parallelizable algorithms.\\

\emph{Automatic computation} cen be further subdivided accordingly to the will
of the user to perform computation on its computer.

\subsubsection{Voluntary computing}

When a user want to share the computational power of its computer to some
project he/she think are worth of it, then might think of using the \ac{BOINC}
system.\\

The \ac{BOINC} system was originally developed to support the \ac{SETI@home}
project, before it became used as a platform for other distributed computing
applications. \ac{BOINC} is an open source middleware system for volunteer
and grid computing. It consist on two parts, the backend server, running on
linux pletfomrs, and the client, cross-platform, for the end-user.\\

This piece of software allow a user to connect to the \ac{BOINC} grid, by doing
so a user is allowing the \ac{BOINC} client to use the idle time of its CPU to
perform computation. The client can now  download all the necessary data from the
chosen project site alonside with the code to run, once all the downloads are
completed the \ac{BOINC} client can run the code and send the results back to
the project site.\\

There are over 40\footnote{At the time of writing.} projects that leverage on
the \ac{BOINC} platform to perform computation on different application areas,
for example the aforementioned \ac{SETI@home} project use this framework to
search for extraterrestrial intelligence by analyzing the narrow-band radio
signal coming from the Arecibo radio telescope.
