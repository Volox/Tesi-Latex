Recent years have seen an increasing interest in \emph{Human Computation}
and \emph{Crowdsourcing} areas. One of the reason they are becoming
so attractive is the growth of the Web. This has allowed to leverage
the ability of people over the internet to perform tasks that even
modern computers cannot achieve properly.

This chapter, first, focus on the key steps and developments
in these fields that lead to the purposes of this thesis.
We provide an overview of \hyperref[sec:bg:crowd:human]{human computation} and
\hyperref[sec:bg:crowd:parasitic]{parasitic computing}, then we introduce the
technologies that enables the distributed computation on the web such as
{\hyperref[sec:bg:web:html5]{HTML5}} for the task distribution and execution
and {\hyperref[sec:bg:web:webcl]{WebCL}} for the task execution.
