Recent years have seen an increasing interest in \emph{Human Computation}
and \emph{Crowdsourcing} areas. One of the reason they are becoming
so attractive is the growth of the Web. This has allowed to leverage
on the ability of people over the Internet to perform tasks that even
modern computers cannot achieve properly.\\

In this chapter are presented the main fields in which a \emph{\myTitle} falls.
Providing a brief introduction to the term used and the core concepts that will
be used during the exposition.

In \autoref{sec:bg:crowd} will introduce the concept of \emph{distributed
computing}, focusing on \emph{\ac{HC}} and \emph{Automatic computation}, from
both the theoretical point of view and to the state of the art tools that
leverages on this techniques.

In \autoref{sec:bg:web} will present the web technologies that enables the 
use of the \emph{distributed computing} paradigm over the web, focusing on the
computational part of the \emph{distributed computing} process.
