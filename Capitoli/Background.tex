Recent years have seen an increasing interest in \emph{Human Computation}
and \emph{Crowdsourcing} areas. One of the reason they are becoming
so attractive is the growth of the Web as a content production and social
interaction platform. This has allowed to leverage on the ability of people over
the Internet to perform tasks.\\

This chapter presents the main research fields related to \emph{harnessing human
intelligence to solve computational problems that are beyond the scope of existing
\ac{AI} algorithms} (\cite{human:comp}), providing a brief introduction to the
terms and the core concepts that will be used during the exposition.

Section \ref{sec:bg:crowd} gives an introduction to the concept of \emph{distributed
computing}, focusing on \emph{\ac{HC}} and \emph{Automatic computation}, from
both the theoretical point of view and to the state-of-the-art tools that
leverages on this techniques.

Section \ref{sec:bg:web} presents the web technologies that enables the 
use of the \emph{distributed computing} paradigm over the web, focusing on the
computational part of the \emph{distributed computing} process.
