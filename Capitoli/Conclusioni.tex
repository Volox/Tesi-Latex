In this thesis we proposed a novel approach for web-based human and machine
computation. By leveraging on the features offered by the modern web browsers,
we provide a framework for designing and implementing general purpose Tasks.
This system allows the user to configure the Task at abstract level and add
all the required custom implementations later, even during the execution.
On top of that our framework offer the possibility to plugin external
logic to tweak the Task execution flow. With this pluggable behavior our framework
is able to support any application archetype (human, automatic and hybrid).

Eventually during this thesis we described three use-cases. This scenarios were
used to evaluate our framework and to test whether the web can be used as a
platform for general Task execution.

\section{Future work}
The described work reveals the hidden potential of the modern web. Our framework
can be extended to meet the scenario proposed by \cite{karame2011pay}. Here we
can use the features of our framework to create an online marketplace for exchanging
computation to contents. Here is a list of other possible enhancements to our work:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Better support for image processing with optimized libraries.
    \item Enhanced Task creation with the implementation of wizards that guide
    the user though the Task creation.
    \item Enriching of the framework with the addition of supported application
    archetype.
\end{itemize}
