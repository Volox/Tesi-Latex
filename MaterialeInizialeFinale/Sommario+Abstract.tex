\chapter*{Abstract}

In the last years a great hype has been seen in the field of \emph{Crowd-based
Computation Distribution}. Methods and techniques have been presented to allow the
distribution of computation not only to computers but also to humans.

The last decade has seen also the definitive explosion of the Web and its evolution.
The Web has evolved from a mere content delivery network, where the contents are
presented to the users, to a collaborative and social tool full of \ac{RIA}. The
advent of \ac{RIA} was possible due to the great evolution of the computation
performance on the client side.

Now we reached the condition where we have the technical ability to use all the
web-users as nodes for a web-based human and machine computation framework.

The aim of this thesis is to present a framework for web-based human and machine
computation able to cover all the possible application archetypes.
